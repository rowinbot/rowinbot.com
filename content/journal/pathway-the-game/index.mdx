Out of a recent burst of inspiration and love for the game of Sequence, I decided to do an online spin-off called [Pathway](https://github.com/rowinbot/pathway) (currently under development) to fullfil the need to play it with our friends and family when we're far. Before getting hands-on I decided to take a look at my stack and checkout all the fascinating tools available in web development these days, and I ended up with the following:

For the web app:

- [Astro.build](https://astro.build/) - for the static parts and the glue between the following:
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - for the game itself.
- [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) - for the lobby (before jumping on a game).
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - styling.

And for the backend:

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - for the API. because of its simplicity and ESM compatibility, I'm using a monorepo with a package called `game-logic` shared between the frontend and backend (using [Pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)).
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) - for the game real-time communication.

I'm also using [Fly.io](https://fly.io) for hosting. I've been using it for a while now and I'm really happy with it. It's a great service and the team behind it is amazing.

If you want to check out the game and play with friends (only way to play it for now), you can do so at: [pathway.rowinbot.com](https://pathway.rowinbot.com).

I'm planning to write a series of posts about the development of this game and the technologies I'll be using to make it, so stay tuned!
