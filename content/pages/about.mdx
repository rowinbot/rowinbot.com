I'm a software engineer from Venezuela 🇻🇪 currently living in 🌅 Tenerife (part of the Canary Islands 🇪🇸/🇮🇨).

I've been coding professionally 🧑🏻‍💻 since 2015, and I've been working remotely ever since 2016 💪. Since then I've worked with a lot of different technologies, coming from a Ruby on Rails background (I learned all about it in 2011) I've worked with a lot of different languages and frameworks, ventured into mobile development 📱 on Android later to get into React Native and Flutter, but I've always been a fan of the web and we all know that means Javascript, so I set myself to master it, and I'm now using frameworks like React and Vue to build apps for the web.

I worked with React (using Remix.run meta-framework) along with Typescript and TailwindCSS to develop this very website. 💄

Since 2020 I've been getting more and more into accessibility and on how to remove the barriers on the web for everyone to enjoy the platform. Because of that I enrolled into the [W3C: Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/e7d6d1981b974b16b6594ae8225d6a51) course were I learnt a lot about the people behind the a11y initiatives and I loved it. I'm now furthering my knowledge on the topic by reading articles, watching talks and trying adhering to the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) guidelines in my projects. I'm advocating for a11y in my workplace ever since.
