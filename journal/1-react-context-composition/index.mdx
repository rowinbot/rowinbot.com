We need to collectively acknowledge although its critical for building scalable components for applications, striking a good level of composition is a challenging feat, not only does it take a good time to think about the feature you want to build but it also requires you to reason about and predict the use-cases the component will have to meet in the future.

**Fortunately** for us, there are multiple patterns we can apply to increase the composability of our components. One of these patterns I've used a lot recently in my work is the `Flexible Compound Components` pattern that comes with batteries-included thanks to the React Context API.

## Flexible Compound Components

Whenever you find yourself using a big component with a lot of props like:

```jsx
<HugeComponent
  prop1={value1}
  prop2={value2}
  prop3={value3}
  prop4={value4}
  prop5={value5}
  prop6={value6}
  prop7={value7}
  prop8={value8}
  prop9={value9}
  prop10={value10}
/>
```
